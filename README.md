# Rubiks-Cube
A Rubik's cube program.

The moveSet variable is where the moves to be done by the program are stored as a list of lists. Move options are therefore:

Front;  [faceF, clockwise] or [faceF, anticlockwise]
Left;   [faceL, clockwise] or [faceL, anticlockwise]
Back;   [faceB, clockwise] or [faceB, anticlockwise]
Right;  [faceR, clockwise] or [faceR, anticlockwise]
Top;    [faceT, clockwise] or [faceT, anticlockwise]
Down;   [faceD, clockwise] or [faceD, anticlockwise]

By changing from 'test = False' to 'test = True' and by copying the above moves into the blank moveSet within the square brackets and separated by a comma, the program will allow for easy tracking of specific cells.

In total ~10 hrs work.
